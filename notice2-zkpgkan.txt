All the data that we have for each observation is provided. If data such
as source port, destination address, etc, is not provided, then we don't
have that data. We may have additional observations collected during the
reporting period, value depending on multiple factors (NATing, source
port availability, etc.)
If you feel you've received this report in error, please let us know.

Regarding Sinkholes:
A sinkhole is a device designed to accept and analyze traffic. Sinkholes
are often used to mitigate malicious activity as well as identify hosts
that are compromised and should be targeted for remediation.
